# Alpha Story - Basic React and TypeScript Test

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in our brief assessment, focusing on React and TypeScript. Designed to be completed within 30 minutes, this test aims to gauge your familiarity with key concepts of both technologies. Don't worry if you find yourself unable to finish all tasks within the allotted timeâ€”it's primarily an opportunity for us to understand your approach and knowledge base. In such cases, we'll provide you with a chance to discuss your thought process and how you would tackle any remaining tasks.

# Test Overview

This test is composed of 5 distinct tasks, each designed to evaluate your proficiency in React and TypeScript through practical challenges. You'll be tasked with creating functions to manage tasks within a To-Do list application and applying styling using Tailwind CSS to enhance its visual appeal.

You are given a very basic To-do List website. You will be required to add some basic functionality to the To-Do list and to add some CSS - using Tailwind - to enhance the look of the List visually.

## Tips & Hints

1. We will also be looking at how you handle your Types - so remember to include them!
2. Remember to comment your code where necessary

## TASK 1: TodoItem Component

Create a new component named `TodoItem` in a file called `TodoItem.tsx`. This component should accept the following props:

- `task`: The task description.
- `deleteTask`: A function to delete the task.
- `toggleComplete`: A function to toggle the task's completion status.

### Functionalities

1. Include a toggle button that marks the task as completed or incomplete.
2. Incorporate a delete button to remove the task.
3. Display the task text.
4. (Optional) Apply some basic Tailwind CSS styling for visual enhancement.

## TASK 2: Task Submission Form

Develop a form that allows users to input a task. The form should comprise:

- A text input field for the task description.
- A submit button to add the task.

### Behavior

- Upon clicking the submit button, the text from the input field should be added as a new task.
- After submission, reset the input field to an empty string ("").

## TASK 3: Tailwind CSS Styling

Demonstrate your Tailwind CSS proficiency by adding style and creativity to the To-Do list. Your styling should:

1. Organize the task items into a three-column grid layout.
2. Encourage you to apply additional stylistic enhancements as you see fit. Be as creative as you'd like!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
